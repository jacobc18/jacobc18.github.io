### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I spent a large amount of my time studying for the OOP exam and for an Algorithms exam. I took both of these exams this past Thursday and I think they both 
went pretty well. The OOP exam was entirely code based and mimicked the in-class process of implementing different methods and classes suggested by Professor Downing. I also 
spent a lot of time setting up an interview that will take place next week in Boston with athenahealth. This took quite some time to plan since I had to figure out travel 
logistics and interview times that would least impact my school schedule.

### What's in my way?
I have to prepare for my interview so I do well this Tuesday in Boston. Also, project 3 has been assigned, so I need to find a partner and begin working on that soon so we have enough time to finish. Along with these tasks come the regular week-to-week tasks such has completing homework, readings, labs, and pre-lab assignments.

### What will I do next week?
I will be traveling to Boston on Monday night, spend Tuesday morning and part of the afternoon interviewing, then fly back to Austin Tuesday night. I will also be starting project 3 for this class and completing my Physics lab. Unfortunately, I will miss my Algorithms class on Tuesday because of the interview. I will be trying to get enough sleep every night, but that will be a challenge this week because of the late night flights to and from the East coast.

### Pick-of-the-week
Here is a useful Google Chrome extension if you love having many tabs open like me. 
[The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg) helps reduce Chrome's memory footprint by 'suspending' tabs 
that have not been used recently. The tab itself remains there and keeps its text and favicon. The suspended tab can be easily reopened by clicking anywhere on the page. This is 
extremely helpful if you have 20+ tabs open at a time and don't use all of them frequently, but want to keep those pages around for later.
