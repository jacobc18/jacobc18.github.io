### What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent a large amount of my time studying for the OOP exam and for an algorithms exam. I took both of these exams this past Thursday and I think they both 
went pretty well. The OOP exam was entirely code based and mimicked the in-class process of implementing different methods and classes suggested by professor Downing. I also 
spent a lot of time setting up an interview on this Tuesday in Boston with athenahealth. This took quite some time to plan since I had to decide on which classes to miss, what flights 
to take, etc.

### What's in my way?
I have to prepare and do well at an interview this Tuesday in Boston. Also, project 3 has been assigned so I need to find a partner and begin working on that early. Along with these 
tasks come the regular week-top-week tasks such has completing homeworks, readings, labs, and pre-lab assignments.

### What will I do next week?
I will be preparing for an upcoming interview, startiung project 3 for this class, flying to Boston for an interview then flying back, missing my algorithms class (sadly) for the 
interview, completing my physics lab, and trying to get enough sleep every night.

### Pick-of-the-week
Here is a useful Google Chrome extension if you love having many tabs open like me. 
[The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg) helps reduce Chrome's memory footprint by 'suspending' tabs 
that have not been used recently. The tab itself remains there and keeps its text and favicon. The suspended tab can be easily reopened by clicking anywhere on the page. This is 
extremely helpful if you have 20+ tabs open at a time and don't use all of them frequently, but want to keep those pages around for later.
