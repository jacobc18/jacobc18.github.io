### What did I do this past week?
This past week I started working on the first project. I still haven't finished the project, however, my code is passing all of the tests on Hackerrank. In class, Professor Downing went over the project and a number of ways of solving it with different types of optimizations. Professor Downing also covered many ways of passing information between functions in Python.

### What's in my way?
I still need to finish the first project. For me, setting up the project and turning it all end seems to take a large portion of time from the overall project. However, I do enjoy learning and using a variety of tools on the projects. I will be doing readings for this class and other classes as well as taking quizzes and doing some assignments.

### What will I do next week?
I will complete the first project and turn it in. Hopefully I will receive a better grade than I did on a similar project I completed in Object Oriented Programming. I will also be trying to get more sleep because I have not been getting enough. Also, exams for classes are approaching quicker than you might think. I will begin studying examples in class as well as notes for the first exam in this course. I will also begin studying material for my other classes. This week will be very busy.

### What else?
After taking Professor Downing's OOP class last semester, I've come to realize that this class is taught in a very similar way. Downing seems to really push for discussion in class and wants everyone to be active. I really enjoy Professor Downing's teaching style and think any CS student at UT would benefit from taking at least one course that he teaches.
