### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP, we went over the default behavior of the default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor methods when it comes to method overriding. Professor Downing also began to teach about inheritance in C++ and used the Shape and Circle example where the Circle class in a child of the Shape parent class. Also, at the beginning of the week there was an entire lecture on the final project. Outside of class, my partner and I have almost finished the final project. In other classes I did not have any exams or anything else that was exciting this past week.

### What's in my way?
My partner and I must finish the final project and turn it in by Thursday night. All that is left is to write documentation, unit tests, and to just make sure everything is in place to turn it in. I have a Physics exam this week so I will be studying for that. On the bright side, I have no more physics labs to do for the rest of the semester. Other than that there are the usual homeworks and quizzes to complete throughout the week. 

### What will I do next week?
Finish the final project with my partner and complete homework assignments, take some quizzes, and study for an take a Physics Exam.

### What else?
The final project has been very exciting compared to the previous ones. It has not been nearly as simple as the previous project and my partner and I had a lot of problems trying to get the Cell class to perform in the correct way. However, after going over the issue in class, we were able to fix the problem and eventually finish most of the project.
