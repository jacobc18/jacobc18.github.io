### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP, we reviewed the default behavior of the default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor methods as it relates to method overriding. Professor Downing also began teaching about inheritance in C++ and used the Shape and Circle example where the Circle class is a child of the Shape parent class. Also, at the beginning of the week, there was an entire lecture on the final project. Outside of class, my partner and I have almost finished the final project. In other classes, I did not have any exams, major projects, or anything else that consumed much of my time this past week.

### What's in my way?
My partner and I must finish the final project and turn it in by Thursday night. All that remains is to write documentation, unit tests, and one final review to just make sure everything is in place before we turn it in. I have a Physics exam this week, so I will be studying for that. On a positive note, I have no more Physics labs to do for the rest of the semester. Other than that, there are the usual homeworks and quizzes to complete throughout the week. 

### What will I do next week?
My partner and I will finish the final project, I will complete homework assignments, study for and take some quizzes, and study for and take a Physics exam.

### What else?
The final project has been very exciting for me and my favorite of all the projects this semester. It has not been nearly as simple as the previous ones, and my partner and I had a lot of problems trying to get the Cell class to perform in the correct way. However, after going over the issue in class, we were able to fix the problem and we are now in the final stages of finishing the project.
