### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I took Exam One for this class. Overall, the exam was not exactly what I had expected, mostly based on the exams in Professor Downing’s OOP class last semester. I was expecting the exam to be writing a lot of code, but as it turned out, it was entirely multiple choice. I’m not entirely sure what I missed on the exam, so I plan on going to office hours next week to see my exam.

### What's in my way?
This week, I don’t have any exams, so there is not too much in my way! It is the last week before Spring break. I will be keeping up with the usual quizzes and homeworks for all of my classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be discussing and planning the next project with my group. We haven’t really decided what our project will be on yet, so we will meet to design our project. This is the project we will be working on for the rest of the semester, therefore it is important that we get the design right. I will also be going to office hours to review my exam and find out which questions I missed. I am looking forward to Spring Break and seeing my family and friends.

### What's my experience of the class?
I’m interested to talk with my friends and classmates in Professor Downing's class to get their perspectives on the first exam, and more specifically, to find out how they prepared. I’m also excited to keep learning more and more about Python and to work on Project 3 and start designing my group’s website.
