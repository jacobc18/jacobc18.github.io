### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I took exam one for this class. Overall, the exam was not exactly what I had expected, mostly due to the exams of Professor Downing's OOP class last semester. I was expecting to be writing a lot of code but, as it turns out, the exam was entirely multiple choice. I'm not entirely sure what I missed on the exam and plan on going to office hours to see my exam next week.

### What's in my way?
This week, I don't have any exams! It is the last week before Spring break. I will be keeping up with the usual quizzes and homeworks for all of my classes. I will also be discussing and planning the next project with my group members. We haven't really decided on what our project will be on yet.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be meeting with my project group member to design our project that we will be working on for the rest of the semester. I am also looking forward to Spring break and seeing my family and friends. I will also be going to office hours to see my exam and what questions I missed.

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm interested to talk with my friends and classmates in the class to see their thoughts on the first exam and how they prepared. I'm also excited to keep learning more and more about Python and also to work on project 3 and start designing my group's website.
