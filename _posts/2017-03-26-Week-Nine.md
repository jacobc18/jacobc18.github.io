### What did I do this past week?
This past week, my Project 3 group and I finished Phase 1 and turned it in. The website is looking good for this stage in the project and I can’t wait to see how it will continue to improve. In class, Professor Downing went over relational algebra and we implemented various relational algebra methods in Python.

### What's in my way?
This week, I need to work on Project 3 and probably meet with my group a few times. I will also be studying for some upcoming exams and keeping up with my other classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be completing quizzes and reading assignments for all of my classes. I also have an appointment on Tuesday at the University Health Center since I’ve been sick for a week and can't seem to shake it. It is awful to be sick during the school year.

### What's my experience of the class?
Working on Project 3 has been exciting since my group has a total of 6 members. It was kind of hectic towards the end, right before we turned it in, because we didn’t realize some of the requirements for our website. So, we had to scramble in order to implement them at the last minute. My primary job was to create the unit tests for the back-end which was fun to learn how to do for Flask models. Overall, it was a good experience and I’m excited for Phase 2.
