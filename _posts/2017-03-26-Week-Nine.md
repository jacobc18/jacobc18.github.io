### What did I do this past week?
This past week, my project 3 group and I finished and turned in project 3. The website is looking good for this stage in the project and I can't wait to see how it continues to improve. In class, Professor Downing went over relational algebra and we implemented various relational algebra methods in Python.

### What's in my way?
This week I need to work on project 3 and probably meet with my group a few times. I will also be studying for some upcoming exams and keeping up with my other classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be completing quizzes and reading assignments for all of my classes, as well as going to the doctor since I've been sick for a week which is awful during the school year. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Working on project 3 was exciting since my group has a total of 6 members. It was kind of hectic towards the end, right before we turned it in, because we didn't realize some of the requirements for our website and had to implement them last minute. My primary job was to create the unit tests for the back-end which was fun to learn how to do for Flask models. Overall it was a good experience and I'm excited for phase 2.
