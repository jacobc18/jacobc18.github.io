### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP, we discussed move semantics which allows us to steal data from one object and give it to another. This is possible whether we were constructing from the first object or reassigning it. We also went over class, local, and global variables and the keyword static combined with those variables. My partner and I finished and turned in Project 4. This turned out to be the most fun project Iâ€™ve worked on so far for this class. Project 4 was also the most OOP related project, as well. My partner and I spent quite some time designing all of the classes for Project 4 before even putting it together. I also had an exam in my Management class as well as an exam in my Algorithms and Complexity class.

### What's in my way?
I do not have any exams or projects due this week. This is a huge relief after having had such a heavy workload the previous week. I have already found a partner for the final project, Project 5. We will begin working on it this week. Other than that, I have the usual homework assignments for classes as well as a lab/prelab for Physics, and a few quizzes to take.

### What will I do next week?
Begin Project 5 with my partner and complete homework assignments, complete Physics lab related work, take some quizzes, and enjoy having a week with no exams or projects due.

### What else?
I was glad that Project 4 was more of an Object-Oriented project. It seemed to me the previous projects did not directly contribute to learning OOP. I hope that Project 5 is a more Object-Oriented project, like Project 4, so that I can continue to learn and apply some of the ideas discussed in class.
