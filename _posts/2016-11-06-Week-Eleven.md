### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP we discussed move semantics which allow us to steal data from one object and give it to another whether we were constructing from the first object or reassigning it. We also went over class, local, and global variables and the keyword static combined with those variables. My partner and I finished and turned turn project 4 which turned out to be the most fun project I've worked on so far for this class. Project 4 was also the most OOP related project so far as well. My partner and I spent quite some time designing all of the classes or project 4 before even putting it together. I also had an exam in my Management class as well as an exam in my Algorithms and Complexity class. 

### What's in my way?
I don't have any exams or projects due this week which is a huge relief after the previous week. I have already found a partner for the final project, project 5, and we will begin working on it this week. Other than that, I have the usual homework assignments for classes as well as lab/prelab for Physics and a few quizzes to take.

### What will I do next week?
Begin project 5 with my partner and complete homework assignments, Physics lab related work, take some quizzes, and enjoy having a week with no exams or projects due.

### What else?
I glad that project 4 was finally a more Object-Oriented project. It seems like the previous projects weren't exactly meant for learning OOP. I hope that project 5 is also an Object-Oriented project so that I can continue to learn and apply some of the ideas mentioned in class.
