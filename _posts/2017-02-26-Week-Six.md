### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I had a Business Law exam as well as a British Literature exam which both went well. In SWE, Professor Downing covered generators in Python which was an entirely new thing for me. However, I'm definitely understanding them well.

### What's in my way?
This week, I only have an exam in this class, which is nice. I will need to study all week to prepare for the exam and prepare my notes. This will include studying notes, preparing my one page of notes and also practicing some Python.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be preparing and taking exam one. Since, there are only two exams for this class for the whole semester, I will need to perform especially well. I will be spending all of my time outside of class studying for this exam and preparing my notes as well as completing a few other weekly assignments for other classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
I can tell students are starting to realize the large amount of information that comes with this class. Students are beginning to ask more and more questions which show a lack of initial misunderstanding that needs to be corrected. Like I said last week, this class is beginning to get into the more difficult parts and I feel like I can tell some others are falling behind based on their questions during lecture. I would advise everyone to keep up with the readings, ask any questions you want answered in class (or on Piazza), and also make sure to review the notes that Professor Downing posts online after every lecture.
