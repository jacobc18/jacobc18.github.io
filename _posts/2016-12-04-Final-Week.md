title: Final Week
---

### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I had 4 exams on Thursday. First, I had a Physics lab final exam followed by an Algorithms final exam. A few hours later, I took a Management exam. And finally, later that night, was the second, and final, OOP exam. This was the first time I’ve ever had so many exams that close together. It was a very stressful week, and a rough day to say the least. However, afterwards it was a nice feeling to know that I was finished with four of my classes for the semester. The only thing that remains for me this semester is a Physics final.

### What's in my way?
Next week, I will attend my last class of the semester and then take my last final on Friday. Since it is the only exam I have left, it should be much easier to study for than the four previous finals last week.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will study for my Physics exam, hopefully do well on it, then head home for winter break.

### Conclusion
Overall, I really enjoyed Professor Downing’s OOP class. His style of teaching is quite different than every other CS professor I have had at UT. I liked all of his analogies and how easily he explained some complex OOP and C++ ideas. What I enjoyed most was probably how organized the entire course and Professor Downing’s lectures were. I could tell that Professor Downing really put a lot of time and thought into his lesson plans and assignments. I know the knowledge, skills, and experience I gained from this class will definitely help me in the future, especially the experience using tools like Travis CI, Docker, and git. I would strongly recommend Professor Downing for anyone who is thinking about taking the class.

I hope everyone has a nice winter break!
