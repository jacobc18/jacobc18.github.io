title: Final Week
---

### What did I do this past week?
This past week I had 4 exams on Thursday. First, I had a physics lab final exam followed by an Algorithms final exam. A few hours later I took a Management exam. Finally, later at night was the second, and final, OOP exam. This was the first time I've ever had so many exams that close together. It was a very stressfull and rough day to say the least. However, afterwards it was nice knowing that I was down with 4 classes for the semester. All that is left for me this semester is Pysics.

### What's in my way?
Next week I will attend my last class of the semester and then take my last final on Friday. Since its the only exam I have left it should be easier to study for than my previous final exams this semester. 

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will study for my Physics exam, take it, then go home for winter break.

### Conclusion
Overall I really enjoyed Professor Downing's OOP class. His style of teaching is alot different than every other CS professor I have had at UT. I liked all of his analogies and how easily he explained some complex OOP and C++ ideas. What I enjoyed most was probably how organized the entire course and Professor Downing's lectures were. I could tell that Professor Downing really put a lot of time and thought into his lesson plans and assignments. I know the knowledge, skills, and experience I gained from this class will definitely help me in the future. Especially the experience with using tools like Travis CI, Docker, git, etc. I would strongly recommend this class for anyone who is thinking about taking it. 

I hope everyone has a nice winter break!
