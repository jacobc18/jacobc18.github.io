### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I met with my Project 3 group and we decided that we were going to do rocket launches for our project, using the [launchlibrary](https://launchlibrary.net/1.1/docs/api.html) api. In class, Professor Downing discussed the third project, including some of the key things he would like to see.

### What's in my way?
This week is Spring Break, so I will be mostly taking a break from school. However I will be thinking about Project 3 and also applying online for internships. I will also be working on a small project of my own, for fun.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be working on phase one of Project 3 with my group. We will be setting everything up so that we will have an easier time in the next few phases. This will include designing the website, setting up the AWS server, collecting 3 instances of our models, and going through some tutorials for things like Flask.

### What's my experience of the class?
I’m excited to start working on Project 3. I know it is going to be a lot of information and will use many tools. This will be the first time I’ve been a part of such a large group trying to deliver a project (my group has 6 members), so I am interested to see how that affects the workflow of the project.
