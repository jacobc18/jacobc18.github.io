### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I got together with my project 3 group and decided that we were going to do rocket launches for our project, using the [launchlibrary](https://launchlibrary.net/1.1/docs/api.html) api. In class, Professor Downing went over the third project and what he would like to see.

### What's in my way?
This week is spring break so I will be mostly taking a break from school, however I will be thinking about project 3 and also applying online for internships. I will also be working on a small project of my own for fun.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be working on phase one of project 3 with my group and setting everything up so that we have an easy time afterwards in the next few phases. This will include designing the website, setting up the AWS server, collecting 3 instances of our models, and going through some tutorials for things like Flask.

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm excited to start working on project 3, I know its going to be a lot of information and tools. This will also be the first time I've been a part of such a large group (my group has 6 members) so I am interested to see how that affects the workflow of the project as well.
