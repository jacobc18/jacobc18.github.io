### What did I do this past week?
This past week, my partner and I completed and turned in the Netflix project. Both of us had previously taken Professor Downing's Object Oriented Programming class and had an idea of how we were going to do the project. SO, the project ended up not taking a large armount of our time and went very smoothly. I also went to both the FoCS Career Fair and the CNS Career Fair and talked to a good amount of companies. I have already had one on-campus interview and I'm still waiting to hear back from a few more companies. 

### What's in my way?
This week I have two excams in other classes so I will be studying for those. Also I need to talk to my friends in my class to figure out who all is going to be in our project 3 group. Next week is the first exam in this class so I will start preparing for that by going over my notes and code samples that Professor Downing has listed on his website.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be taking exams, one in British Literature and another in Business Law and Ethics. I will be studying for these exams up until I take them. Afterwards I will start preparing for the first Software Engineering Exam that will take place the following Thursday.

### What's my experience of the class?
The class is finally getting to the more difficult sections and getting deeper into Python. I enjoy learning all of the cool things that you can do with Python such as writing multiple for loops and if statements within a single line.
