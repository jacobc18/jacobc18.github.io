### What did I do this past week?
This past week, we continued covering refactoring strategies in class which involved a lot of Java code examples. My group finished and turned in the last part of the project. Now all we have left is the presentation. I had a video interview with a software engineer from Atlassian and it went well.

### What's in my way?
This week, I need to finish my part of the presentation for my group's project and go through with the presentation on Friday. I will also being going downtown to interview with some software engineers from Atlassian at their office, which will hopefully go well and I can secure an internship for the summer with such a cool company. I will also have to deal with the usual quizzes and assignments in all of my classes and begin studying for the last exam in this class as well as for finals in some other courses.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be interviewing at Atlassian's downtown Austin office for a software engineering internship position as well as keeping up with all of the usual requirements for my various classes. Currently, I am putting most of my time into preparing for the interviews.

### What's my experience of the class?
I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and am pleased about how it went. It was the first time I had to work with so many group members (my group had 6 members) and it was very eye-opening. I learned that is can be very chaotic working with so many other people, especially if they aren't experienced at working with a group of that size as well. However, in the end each of us were able to contribute a lot to the project.
