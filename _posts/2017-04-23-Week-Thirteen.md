### What did I do this past week?
This past week, we continued to learn about refactoring strategies in class, which involved a lot of Java code examples. My group finished and turned in the last part of the project. Now, all we have left is the presentation. I also had a video interview with a software engineer from Atlassian for an internship position. I thought it went well.

### What's in my way?
This week, I need to finish my part of the presentation for my group’s project. Then I will do the actual presentation on Friday. I will also being going downtown on Tuesday to interview with some software engineers from Atlassian. Hopefully, the interviews will go well and I can secure an internship for the summer with such a cool company. I will also have to deal with the usual quizzes and assignments in all of my classes and I need to begin studying for the last exam in this class. I will also start preparing for finals in some other courses.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be interviewing at Atlassian, as well as keeping up with all of the usual requirements for my various classes. Currently, I am putting most of my time into preparing for the interviews.

### What's my experience of the class?
I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and am pleased about how it went. It was the first time I had to work with so many group members (my group had 6 members) and it was very eye-opening. I learned that is can be very chaotic working with so many other people, especially if they aren’t experienced at working with a group of that size as well. However, in the end, each of us were able to contribute a lot to the project.
