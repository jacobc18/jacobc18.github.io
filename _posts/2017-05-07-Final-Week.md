### Thoughts on Spring 2017 CS373 Software Engineering with Professor Glenn Downing
This past week was the final for this course and classes consisted of final project presentations which were interesting because I got to see how other groups designed and implemented their websites as well how they used certain tools and if they used different tools. I also took the second exam and did well! The rest of this post will be about my thoughts on the class in its entirety. Overall, I think this class would be an awesome course to take if you want someone of a taste of what it is like working in the industry. This is because the group projects each had 5-6 group members and the project was split up into phases. The project also required the use of certain tools that are relevent to the industry. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and learning a lot of new information about tools and how web development works in general. It was exciting getting to work with so many other people and discussing tools, implementation, and working on different problems. The lectures are awesome as well, in my opinion. Some of the lectures can seem boring or too easy (Specifically the XML lecture...) but overall I enjoy Downing's teaching style and how he manages to get every person in the class involved in the discussion. If you are someone who doesn't like to go to class then I might not suggest this class since there is a mandatory quiz at the beginnig of most of the lectures. Also, Professor Downing suggest many useful and interesting readings that are going to contain beneficial information for any computer science major. He also offers extra credit for going to talks from certain companies who come and give talks on campus which is helping for your grade and also for seeing what the industry is actually like and how companies are different from each other in many ways, from their technologies to their cultures. If you want to get a piece of what web development is like, or want to learn about Python, or SQL, XML, some Java, refactoring, or some combination of these subjects then this class is also for you! Professory Downing covers all of these topics and each of them are important for anyone considering going into the industry. In conclusion, I highly recommend professory Glenn Downing's Software Engineering class for any computer science student. The information is extremely useful and the experience gained through the projects is priceless.
