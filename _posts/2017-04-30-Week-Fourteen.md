### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I had an interview at Atlassian’s office for a summer internship software development position. I thought the interview went pretty well and I expect to hear back from them this week. In class, Professor Downing finished covering refactoring strategies and some Java concepts. On Friday, we started project presentations. My group was the first group to present and I think it went really well. We also got feedback from the group after us regarding what they thought about our website. Their input was helpful.

### What's in my way?
This week, I will be spending the majority of my time preparing for the second exam for this class. I don’t have any exams in my other classes this week which will definitely help in studying for the one in this class. Other than that, I have some quizzes and assignments in other classes to keep up with, as well as some readings.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be studying for the last exam for this class. I’m hoping to perform a lot better than I did on the first exam. It should be easier since I will have more time to study than I did for the previous exam. Last time, I had multiple exams about the same time, so I wasn't able to focus my study effort. The material itself, however, seems a bit more complex this time and covers more subjects than the previous exam, which was mostly Python.

### What's my experience of the class?
Now that the class is basically over and all that is left is other group presentations and the last exam, I will say that overall I really enjoyed this class. I think Professor Downing’s style of teaching and personality really helped. I would have to say that Professor Downing is definitely one of my favorite professors I have had so far in my 3 years at UT and I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class with him, as well as his Object Oriented Programming course last semester. What I really enjoyed about his teaching style is how he manages to get every student involved. Because of this, he is able to take many seemingly-boring topics and make them fun and exciting through this interaction. I also loved the final project. Working with 5 other students was very new to me but also extremely exciting. I learned a lot more than I expected about both the technical and the teamwork aspects associated with these types of projects.
