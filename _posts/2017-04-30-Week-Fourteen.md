### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I had an interview at Atlassian's office for a summer internship software development position. The interview went pretty well and I will be hearing back from them this week. In class Professory Downing finished covering refactoring strategies and some Java concept and on Friday we started project presentations. My group was the first group to present their project and I think it went really well. We also got to hear from the group after us what they thought about our website and their criticisms which was helpful.

### What's in my way?
This week, I will be spending the majority of my time preparing for the second exam for this class. I don't have any exams in classes classes this week which will definitely help in studying for the exam for this class. Other than that, I have some quizzes and assignments in other classes to keep up with as well as some readings.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be studying for the last exam for this class. I'm hoping to perform a lot better than I did on the first exam which should be easier since I have more time to study than I did for the previous exam due to less exams in other classes. The material itself however seems more complex and covers more subjects than the previous exam which was mostly Python.

### What's my experience of the class?
Now that the class is basically over and all that is left is other group presentations and the last exam, I will say that overall I really enjoyed this class and I think Professor Downing's style of teaching and personality really helped. I would have to say that Professor Downing is definitely one of my favorite professors I have had so far in my 3 years here at UT and I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class with him as well as his Object Oriented Programming course. What I really enjoyed about his teaching style is how he manages to get every student involved and make many seemingly-boring subjects fun and exciting through this interaction. I also loved the final project he came up with and working with 5 other students was very new to me but also extremely exciting and I learned a lot more than I expected about both technical and social aspects of working on projects.
