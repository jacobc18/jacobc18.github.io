### What did I do this past week?
This past week, in class Professory Downing covered regex (regular expression), XML, and SQL. The regex lecture was extremely valuable to me. I have never taken the time to learn regex on my own, and have never been taught it before, but I know it's very popular and quite useful in many situations. The XML lecture was kind of different and I'm not exactly sure ewhy Professory Downing decided to cover it. But I do know its useful to know and so the lecture was overall a good choice. The SQL lecture was extremely useful since we already covered relational algebra and it should help with our project as well. For the project, I fixed the unit tests I originally wrote for phase 3 and added some more unit tests for phase 4.

### What's in my way?
This week, I have a quiz in my Business Law class that is worth a good amount of my overall grade so I will bestudying for that as well as studying for an exam in my British Literature class that is toward the end of the week. I wil also be keeping up with daily quizzes and readings for all of my classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be studying for exams and hopefully doing well on them. I will also be keeping up with assignments in all of my classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
It's been nice overing so many different topics in lecture and finally getting to work with something other than Python. I'm really enjoying learning about relational algebra and SQL since I know those are very important topics when it comes to software engineering. 

### Atlassian Presentation
On Monday night I went to Atlassian's presentation at the GDC. I really enjoyed their talk and a lot of their topics. I liked how they went into detail about some problems that they have encountered on the project that they're working with. I also enjoyed their coverage of Atlassian as a company and their culture. I recently took an online coding challenge to try and get an internship with Atlassian and ended up talking on the phone with one of theiur recruiters this week. I will be hearing back on whether or not I will have the opportunity to interview with them later this week.
