### What did I do this past week?
This past week in class, we covered refactoring strategies in class which involved a lot of Java code examples. The lessons were extremely useful and important for industry level work. My project group started the final phase of the project. This week I implemented the search capabilities of our API and also fixed a large amount of bugs on the front end related to sorting and filtering. I also had a video interview with Atlassian which went pretty well.

### What's in my way?
This week, my project group and I have to finish and turn in the final phase of the project. I plan to deal with any backend issues and/or bugs that arise as the members mainly working on the frontend start implementing our search page. I might also help out with the visualization of another group's API. I don't have any exams this week which is nice, so I plan on devoted a lot of time to the final phase of the project for this class.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be spending most of my time working on the final project phase and making sure it all comes together nicely. It has been kind of hard considering there are a total of six members in my project group and there is a lot of code to go through and clean even after it has all be written, for the most part. I will also be hearing back from Atlassian and hopefully moving on to the next interviewing step.

### What's my experience of the class?
Iâ€™ve enjoyed learning about refactoring since I've never been formally taught or read up on how to go about doing it. It has been interesting seeing the different strategies employed and I would highly recommend anyone who is going to work in the industry to read up on proper refactoring techniques.
