### What did I do this past week?
This past week, we covered refactoring strategies in class which involved a lot of Java code examples. The lessons were extremely useful and important for industry level work. My group started the final phase of the project. This week, I implemented the search capabilities of our API and also fixed a large quantity of bugs on the front-end related to sorting and filtering. I also had a video interview for a summer internship with Atlassian. I thought the interview went pretty well.

### What's in my way?
This week, my project group and I have to finish and turn in the final phase of the project. I plan to deal with any back-end issues and bugs that arise as the other team members, who are mainly working on the front-end, start implementing our search page. I might also help out with the visualization of another group’s API. I don’t have any exams this week, which is nice, so I plan to devote a lot of time to the final phase of the project for this class.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be spending most of my time working on the final project phase and making sure it all comes together. It has been a bit of a challenge considering there are a total of six members in my project group. There is a lot of code to go through and clean even after it has all be written. Next week, I also expect to hear back from Atlassian and hopefully moving on to the next step in the interview process.

### What's my experience of the class?
I’ve enjoyed learning about refactoring since I've never been formally taught or read up on how to go about doing it. It has been interesting seeing the different strategies employed and I would highly recommend anyone who is going to work in the industry to read up on proper refactoring techniques.
