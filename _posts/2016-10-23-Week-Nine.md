### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I had a physics exam, a technical phone call interview with Facebook, a few on-site interviews with HomeAway here in Austin, and all of my usual classes and homework. My partner 
and I also finished up project 3 and turned it in. In class we continued to discuss how our written default and overloaded constructors affect how memory is allocated to us. We also implemented 
a simple version of vector in class in order to help see how the C++ vector class works and is used.

### What's in my way?
Project 4 has just been assigned and I've already found a partner. I hope to start earlier and work on the project every day this week since this is just about the first week I've had no other 
big assignments, interviews, or exams throughout the week. I'll have to complete and turn in a few assignments for my physics classes, management class, and algorithms and complexity class as well. 
I'll also try and get more sleep and eat healthy, especially since I seem to have gotten sick at the start of this weekend. I'll also start studying for an upcoming exam in my algorithms and complexity class as well as for an exam in my management class.

### What will I do next week?
I will be doing work for all of my classes. I will be finishing a physics lab, completing a physics homework, doing OOP readings, starting project 4, taking management quizzes, studying for exams, and finishing an algorithms homework assignment.

### Tip-of-the-week
This weekâ€™s tip-of-the-week is to maintain a healthy diet and make sure to stay hydrated. Getting sick during the semester is NOT fun. It also makes it more difficult to complete assignments and go to classes. This is especially important going into the winter season. Stay healthy!
