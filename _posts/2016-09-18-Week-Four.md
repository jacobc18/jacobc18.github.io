### What did I do this past week?
This past week started off with a lot of learning about pointers and references in C++. I am beginning to understand pointers and references 
a lot better than at the beginning of the class. On Wednesday we had a guest speaker come in who was a software engineer from Bloomberg 
and who had previously taken Professor Downing's OOP class. He gave a lot of insight as to what the real world of software engineering 
has to offer. Friday consisted of learning about iterators in C++.

### What's in my way?
I still need to practice and learn more about pointers and references in C++, finish project 2, prepare for the career fair that is on Tuesday, 
complete some homework assignments, and study for a physics midterm that will take place on Wednesday.

### What will I do next week?
Next week I will finish and turn in project 2, go to the CNS career fair, and hopefully do well on a physics midterm. I hope to meet a lot 
of interesting people and companies at career fair and get some interviews so I can have an internship for next summer. I will also 
continue to practice and study C++ and all of its nuances.

### What else?


### Pick-of-the-week
The big career fair is this Tuesday and I would recommend burshing up on your interview skills as well as studying some 
interview questions and material. Here is a relatively short blog post by someone in UTCS on CS interviews: [https://login.cs.utexas.edu/blog/how-interview](https://login.cs.utexas.edu/blog/how-interview)
