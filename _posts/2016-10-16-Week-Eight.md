### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I flew to Boston on Monday after classes and woke up early Tuesday morning for interviews at athenahealth. Several hours later, it was back to the airport for a flight back to Austin. The rest of the week was pretty normal. I worked on homeworks and labs. My partner and I got started on project 3. We hope to be finishing soon. In class, we started learning about how the C++ Allocator works. This is important material because it is the basis for project 3.

### What's in my way?
My partner and I need to complete project 3 and turn it in. I also need to complete some more homeworks and study for a physics exam that will take place on Wednesday. On Thursday, I have an interview with Facebook. It is a phone interview, but I will need to prepare the same as if it were face to face. I also need to prepare for an on-site interview that will take place on Friday with a different company. In addition, I will also need to complete my physics lab from last week. And, as always, try to get enough sleep and eat healthy.

### What will I do next week?
I will be doing work for all of my classes. I will be preparing for a Physics exam, finishing a physics lab, completing a physics homework, doing OOP readings, preparing for interviews, and going to the actual interviews.

### Pick-of-the-week
This weekâ€™s tip-of-the-week is to prepare for the behavioral questions that interviewers will ask. My experience has been that interviews typically have a technical component and a behavioral component. A lot of CS students prepare only, or mostly, for the technical questions. But, being ready for the behavioral questions is just as important!
