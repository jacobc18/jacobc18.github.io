### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I flew to Boston on Monday after classes and woke up early Tuesday morning for an interview and flew back to Austin afterwards. The rest of the week was pretty normal. I worked on homeworks and labs. My partner and I also started project 3 and hope to be finishing soon. In class we started learning about how the C++ Allocator works which is also what project 3 is based on. 

### What's in my way?
My partner and I need to complete and turn in project 3. I also need to complete some more homeworks and study for a physics exam that will take place on Wednesday. On Thursday I have an interview call with Facebook so I will need to prepare for that as well as an on-site interview on Friday with a different company. I will also need to complete my physics lab from last week. And, as always, try to get enough sleep and eat healthy.

### What will I do next week?
I will be doing work for all of my classes. I will be preparing for a Physics exam, finishing a physics lab, completing a physics homework, doing OOP readings, preparing for interviews, and going to the actual interviews. 

### Pick-of-the-week
This week's tip-of-the-week is to prepare for the behavioral questions that interviewers will ask you as well as for the technical questions. A lot of CS students prepare only, or mostly, for the technical questions but the behavioral questions are just as important!
