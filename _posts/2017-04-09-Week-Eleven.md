### What did I do this past week?
This past week in class, we continued on our journey learning SQL. Which has taken some time to get used to, however it is definitely useful information. My project group and I finished phase 2 and turned it in about 15 minutes before it was due. THere was a lot of stress at the end of this phase as we were trying to pull everything together in time to turn the project in. We ended up missing a few small requirements but I'm hoping that it won't cause too much of a deduction on your grade.

### What's in my way?
This week, I have a Business Law exam so I will be taking that and hopefully doing well. I will also begin implementing some new features on my group's project that are required for the final phase. I am also interested to see how other group's APIs work and to begin working with them. I also have to keep up with the usual quizzes, readings, and studying for all of my classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be taking an exam and doing a lot of work on my groups project. I already know some d3.js so I will probably be the group member who implements the data visualization required for phase 3. I will also be taking quizzes and completing readings for multiple classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
I've enjoyed learning about SQL over the past week but I'm definitely excited to move on to another topic. However, the next topic is Refactoring which I don't think will be too exciting although I know all of the informatin will most likely be very useful just like most everything else presented in this class.
