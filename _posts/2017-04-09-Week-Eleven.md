### What did I do this past week?
This past week in class, we continued on our journey learning SQL. This has taken some time to get used to, however it is definitely useful information. My project group and I finished Phase 2 and turned it in about 15 minutes before it was due. There was a lot of stress at the end of this phase as we were trying to pull everything together in order to turn it in on time. In the end, we missed a few small requirements, but I’m hoping that it won’t cause too much of a deduction on our grade.

### What's in my way?
This week, I have a Business Law exam, so I will be preparing for and then taking it. Hopefully, I will do well. I will also begin implementing some new features on my group’s project that are required for the final phase. I am also interested to see how other groups' APIs work and to begin working with them. I will also have to keep up with the usual quizzes, readings, and studying for my other classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be taking an exam and doing a lot of work on my group's project. I already know some d3.js, so I will probably be the group member who implements the data visualization required for Phase 3. I will also be taking quizzes and completing readings for multiple classes.

### What's my experience of the class?
I’ve enjoyed learning about SQL over the past week, but I’m definitely excited to move on to another topic. However, the next topic is Refactoring. I don’t know how exciting it will be, but I know the information will be useful, just like most everything else that has been presented in this class.
