### What did I do this past week?
Within the hour it was due, I finished and turned in my project 1 assignment. It’s a huge relief to be done with the semester’s first project. In class, Professor Downing lectured on pointers and references in C++. For the most part, I haven’t been too good with pointers; so, it was a great learning experience for me.

### What's in my way?
One of my obstacles is having adequate time. This week, I need to complete many homework assignments for all of my classes; as well as, complete some readings. There are also a few quizzes in my other classes that need to be taken and I need to begin studying for a physics exam.

### What will I do next week?
During the week I will do my readings for this class. I will also enjoy not having another project due just yet. This will allow me to focus a bit more on my other classes. In addition to coursework, I need to start preparing for the career fair. Hopefully, I can get some additional interviews.

### What else?
Professor Downing’s OOP class continues to be very interesting and always has me focused during class. This week, Professor Downing called out some students who seemed to be slacking on staying active on Piazza. I’m sure they will be more active this upcoming week.

### Pick-of-the-week
I do not like being surrounded by too much sound while studying, working, programming, etc.; so, I have come to use a variety of ambient sound sites while working. There are quite a few sites available that offer ambient sound. Two of my favorites are [asoftmurmur.com](http://asoftmurmur.com/), which lets you customize the exact kind of ambient sound you want, and [coffitivity.com](https://coffitivity.com/), which has a variety of work-place ambient sounds. There are also plenty of youtube videos that play white noise, pink noise, brown noise, etc. Personally, my favorite is brown noise, which is a lot calmer than white or pink noise. For more information on the colors of noise, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise).
