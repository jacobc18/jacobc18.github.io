### What did I do this past week?
This past week I finished and turned in my project 1 assignment within the hour that is was due. What a relief it is to be done with the semester's first project. 
In class Professor Downing lectured on pointers and references in C++. I've never really been to good with pointers and such so it was a great learning experience 
for me.

### What's in my way?
I need to do a lot of homework assignments for all of my classes as well as complete some readings. I have a few quizzes in other classes I need to take and a physics exam to 
begin studying for.

### What will I do next week?
Next week I will do my readings for this class as well as enjoy not having another project due just yet. This will allow mye to focus a bit mroe on my other classes. 
I also have to start preparing for the career fair so I can hopefully get some more interviews.

### What else?
Professor Downing's OOP class continues to be very interesting and always has me focused during class. This week Professor Downing called out some students who 
seemed to be slacking on staying active on Piazza. I'm sure that after this past week they will be more active. 

### Pick-of-the-week
I really don't like being surrounded by too much sound while studying, working, programming, etc., so I have come to use a variety of ambient sound sites while working. 
There are quite a few sites out there that offer ambient sound as well as some Youtube videos. Here are some of my favorites: [asoftmurmur.com](http://asoftmurmur.com/) 
lets you customize exactly what kind of ambient sound you want to listen to, [coffitivity.com](https://coffitivity.com/) has a variety of work-place ambient sounds 
to listen to, and there are plenty of youtube videos that play white noise, pink noise, brown noise, etc. Personally, my favorite is brown noise which is a lot calmer 
than white or pink noise. For more information on the colors of noise, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise).
