### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I started the Netflix project with my partner. We managed to complete most of it in one day. I also edited my resume for the CNS career fair this week and the FoCS career fair as well. In class, Professor Downing went over the Netflix project and how to calculate RMSE. Professor Downing also went over variables in Python and how they compare to variables in other languages, like Java.

### What's in my way?
My partner and I need to finish the Netflix project and turn it in before Thursday night. I will be going to two career fairs this week so I will be very busy. However, I should have a good amount of time to work on the project afterwards. Also I have two exams in other courses the following week so I will need to start preparing for those. I've also got to complete many readings and exercises for other classes.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, I will be preparing for exams in other courses, going to two career fairs and hopefulling getting a few interviews, finishing the Netflix project, completing exercises and homeworks for my classes, and, as always, trying to get a good amount of sleep and maintain a healthy diet.

### What's my experience of the class?
Professor Downing really tries to make sure that everyone in the class fully understands every little thing he covers about Python. Professor Downing is also well-known among his students for coming up with great analogies to help do so.
