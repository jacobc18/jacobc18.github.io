### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I fnished and turned in the first SWE project. The project was similar to the first project I completed last semester in Downing's OOP course. However, this one was easily solvable using a simple meta cache. Downing made a few changes to the project near the time it was due which I know was annoying to many other students, however it didn't bother me too much. I understand that my class is basically testing the process for completing and turning in the projects for this course and things still aren't finalized. ALong with learning some more nuances of Python when compared to Java, there was a talk from a recruiter from Bloomberg which was very interesting to hear about since he went over all of the technology and tools they use and their development process.

### What's in my way?
I need to find a partner and start the second SWE project as soon as possible. I also have readings and assignments in other classes to deal with. Exams are also getting closer and closer.

### What will I do next week?
I will be starting the second SWE project this week and will be working with a partner. I'm not entirely sure who my partner will be yet but I have a few people in mind currently. I will also be trying to do well on all of the class quizzes, as well as completing some assignments and readings for all of my classes. Finally, I will improve my resume for career fair and also try and stay healthy and get a good amount of rest.

### What's my experience of the class?
I still heavily enjoy Downing's teaching style and this class. It's slowly getting more and more interesting as we dive deeper into Python. I also like how Downing invited Bloomberg to speak to our class since it gives us a good picture of what its like working in the industry.
