### What did I do this past week?
This past week, I finished and turned in the first SWE project. The project was similar to the first project I completed last semester in Professor Downing’s OOP course. However, this one was easily solvable using a simple meta cache. Professor Downing made a few changes to the project near the due date. Although this was annoying to many of the students, it didn’t bother me too much. I understand that my class is basically testing the process for completing and turning in projects for this course and things still aren’t finalized. Along with learning more of the nuances of Python, as compared to Java, there was a presentation from a recruiter from Bloomberg which was very interesting. It was very informative to hear about all the technology, tools, and development process used by Bloomberg.

### What's in my way?
I need to find a partner and start the second SWE project as soon as possible. I also have readings and assignments in other classes that will compete for my time. The first round of exams are getting closer and closer.

### What will I do next week?
I will be starting the second SWE project this week and will be working with a partner. Even though I’m not sure who my partner will be, I have a few people in mind currently. I will also be preparing for, and trying to do well on all of the class quizzes. I also have to complete some assignments and readings for my other classes. Finally, I will fine tune my resume for the Career Fair and also try to stay healthy and get a good amount of rest.

### What's my experience of the class?
I still really enjoy Professor Downing’s teaching style and this class. It’s slowly getting more and more interesting as we dive deeper into Python. I also like how Professor Downing invited the guest speaker from Bloomberg to our class since it provided us with a good picture of what it will be like working in industry.
