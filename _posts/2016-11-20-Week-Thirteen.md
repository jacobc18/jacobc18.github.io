### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP, we went over some of the more detailed aspects of constructors, destructors, and virtualization. We also had guests from Spiceworks come and tell us about their company and give tips on how to get hired. On Friday Professor Downing went over abstract classes in in C++ and in Java. My partner and I finished and turned in the final project. I also took a Physics exam this week which was my last physics exam of the semester. All that is left is the Physics final. 

### What's in my way?
Next week is Thanksgiving break! There aren't any more projects so I won't have any of those to worry about. However, after we come back from the break I have a few exams. So I will need to be studying for those during Thanksgiving break.

### What will I do next week?
Next week I'll be going to class for two days then heading back to Houston to see my family for Thanksgiving break. I will also be studying for exams and completing some extra credit for a few classes over the break.

### What else?
On the Thursday after Thanksgiving break I have 4 exams: a Physics lab final, an Algorithms and Complexity exam, a Management exam, and the final OOP exam. So, that week is going to be a rough one and I will need to study quite a bit over the break. 


I hope everyone has a nice Thanksgiving break!
