### What did I do this past week?
This past week in OOP, we reviewed some of the more detailed aspects of constructors, destructors, and virtualization. We also had guests from Spiceworks visit our class and provide information about their company and some useful tips on how to get hired. On Friday, Professor Downing went over abstract classes in C++ and in Java. My partner and I finished and turned in the final project. I also took a Physics exam this week. This was my last Physics exam of the semester. All that remains is the final. 

### What's in my way?
Next week is Thanksgiving break! There are no more projects, so I will not have any of those to worry about. However, after we come back from the break I have a few exams prior to finals. So, I will need to be studying for those during Thanksgiving break.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, Iâ€™ll be going to class for two days then driving to Houston to see my family for Thanksgiving break. The day after Thanksgiving, my family and I will actually come back to Austin for the football game against TCU. I will also be studying for exams and completing some extra credit for a few classes over the break.

### What else?
On the Thursday after Thanksgiving break, I have 4 exams: a Physics lab final, an Algorithms and Complexity exam, a Management exam, and the final OOP exam. So, that week is going to be a rough one and I will need to study quite a bit over the break. 


I hope everyone has a nice Thanksgiving break!
