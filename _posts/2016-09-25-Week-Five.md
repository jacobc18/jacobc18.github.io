### What did I do this past week?
My partner and I turned in our Netflix project a day before it was due. It was such a relief to have that project done with. In lecture I learned all about the different types of 
iterators in C++ and how to use them. On Wednesday we had a guest speaker from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) come and talk about what he does at JPL and what it is like to be 
a software engineer there. This week I also had a few interviews with some companies that I talked to at career fair.

### What's in my way?
This week I have another interview scheduled that I must prepare for. I also have an exam in one of my other classes to study for. I should also start preparing for the first exam 
in this class that is on Thursday of the following week.

### What will I do next week?
Next week I will prepare for an interview, and exam in another class, and begin to study for the first exam in this class. 

### Pick-of-the-week
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is cool javascript library for creating data visualizations with useful data-driven transformations. It is definitely a fun library to use 
and create visualizations with. I had to learn how to use this library and became very familiar with it at my previous internship. It has a high learning curve but 
it is definitely worth the time and effort required to get the hang of it. I urge you to go to the website and check out some of the interesting and fun sample visualizations!
