### What did I do this past week?
The first week of class has already been filled with loads of new information. First, Professor Downing introduced himself and then proceeded to go over the class syllabus. The syllabus covered a large number of topics relating to the class such as the class site (<http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs371p/>), grading, projects, developer tools, etc. It was very clear that this class is going to require a good amount a work and will result in me learning a lot. Then we went over the typical "Hello world!" program in C++ and compared it to Java. Later we covered assertions in C++, unit tests using gtest, and coverage statistics using gcov. After the week ended I began setting up this blog.

### What's in my way?
There are a lot of things i need to do in order to stay prepared for this class. I still need to set up Docker on my Windows machine. There are also a few readings I need to take care of for the classes next week. Lastly, it would probably help to do a few simple C++ tutorials since I have very little experience writing C++.

### What will I do next week?
Next week I will complete the assigned readings for class, study for the daily quizzes, complete some C++ tutorials, and set of Docker so I can start the first project. 

### What else?
So far I've really enjoyed being in Professor Downing's class. Something different from my previous CS classes I've taken is how social Professor Downing makes the class. During class Professor Downing will call on students at random and ask them questions about the topic he is currently covering. I really like this style of teaching because it keeps everyone focused on the class material and creates a lot of interactivity.

### Pick-of-the-week
[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is a great way to practice your coding skills, access free tutorials, see how your code compares to others', and potentially find an internship/job. The site has many challenges on topics such as data structures, algorithms, mathematics, AI, etc. and contains tutorials and problems for a lot of programming languages.
